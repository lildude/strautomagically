SUMMARY:1:15 - Capulin
DESCRIPTION:TSS 41, IF 0.57.  Power Based Description: Warm Up:     - Ride for 5 minutes gradually raising your     power from 102 to 141     watts.      Main Set:      Settle in for 65 minutes between 141 and     154 watts.     Cool Down:     - Spin easy for 5 minutes. RPE Based Description: Warm Up:  - Ride for 5 minutes gradually raising your power from RPE 4 to RPE 6.    Main Set:   Settle in for 65 minutes at RPE 6.  Cool Down:  - Spin easy for 5 minutes. Goals: Aerobic Endurance workouts are aimed at improving your aerobic-power-producing capabilities in a low-stress manner. By riding for increasingly longer periods of time, your endurance muscle fibers become more efficient at utilizing fat for fuel and sparing sugar stores for more intense efforts. Additionally, Endurance workouts like this can improve oxygen delivery & utilization, increase muscular resistance to fatigue, improve integrity of connective tissue, and even help you improve your on-bike nutrition strategies.

SUMMARY:1:30 - McGregor
DESCRIPTION:TSS 98, IF 0.81, kJ(Cal) 1032.  Description: McGregor is made up of 3x20-minute intervals at 88% FTP. Each long interval is split in half by a single 60-second recovery valley.5-minute recoveries fall between intervals.  Goals: Sweet Spot work lays the foundation on which we build higher & higher FTP's and is also the high end of half-distance triathlon power. Build the muscle endurance necessary to power up short hills without flooding your muscles with acidic fatigue via long Sweet Spot intervals and minimal rest periods.This is an uncomfortable but productive power range that doesn't require the same level of recovery as Threshold workouts yet yields many of the same benefits. Intervals like these allow you to work reasonably hard for long durations and do it frequently.Try to maintain a reasonably quick cadence of 85-95rpm over the course of this workout.

SUMMARY:1:15 - Mindego
DESCRIPTION:TSS 89, IF 0.84.  Power Based Description: Warm Up: - Ride for 15 minutes, 50 seconds gradually  raising your power from 128  to 256.  - 4 minutes, 50 seconds easy.  Main Set: 5x5 minutes at 274 watts with 4 minutes, 50  seconds rest between intervals.  Cool Down: - Spin easy for 10 minutes. RPE Based Description: Warm Up: - Ride for 15 minutes, 50 seconds gradually  raising your power from RPE 4 to 8.  - 4 minutes, 50 seconds easy.  Main Set: 5x5 minutes at RPE 9 with 4 minutes, 50  seconds rest between intervals.  Cool Down: - Spin easy for 10 minutes. Goals: A noticeable drop from typical VO2 Max power allows far greater time at a potentially very productive power output well above your current sustainable power.The intent is to build greater muscular endurance and mental toughness by working at a high percentage of your maximal oxygen uptake with repeats that thoroughly stress your aerobic system.Shoot for a cadence above 85rpm, above 95rpm if possible.

SUMMARY:1:15 - Eagle -1
DESCRIPTION:TSS 110, IF 0.94, kJ(Cal) 980.  Description: Eagle -1 consists of 5x10-minute intervals between 101-105% FTP with brief, 2-minute recoveries.  Goals: The goal of Threshold workouts is to extend high power over greater durations and stave off muscle fatigue in the process. So each iteration of this particular type of suffering will usually include more or longer work intervals than the version before it and the recovery valleys often shrink from training phase to training phase. These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position. Strive to keep your cadence in that 85-95rpm range, higher if it suits you.

SUMMARY:1:30 - Brooks
DESCRIPTION:TSS 97, IF 0.81, kJ(Cal) 1037.  Description: Brooks totals just under 60 minutes of Tempo intervals spent between 90-91% FTP with intermittent, 3-minute recoveries at 55% FTP.  Goals: The goal here is to continue building aerobic power while refining your climbing technique and familiarizing your body with the different stresses of climbing.Additionally, there's focus on turning the pedals with higher than usual force while still remaining relaxed. You'll also target particular quadrants of the pedalstroke in order to keep power on the pedals more effectively throughout the entire 360-degree pedalstroke by focusing on lifting upward and kicking foward.These intervals are meant to simulate climbs, so try to use cadences that most closely mimic ones you'll use on grades you're likely to encounter in your events or rides.Recommended cadence is above 75rpm when seated and above 65rpm when standing.

SUMMARY:0:30 - Recess -5
DESCRIPTION:TSS 12, IF 0.50, kJ(Cal) 230.  Description: The Recess rides range anywhere from 20-60 minutes in duration at roughly 50% FTP.Exhausted rides, also referred to as 'accumulation rides' are performed within 4-24 hours after your last key workout, race, or event - any other physically stressful ride works as well. These rides should leave you no more fatigued than you were before you hopped on your bike and there are no strict rules governing effort level as long as these feel recuperative and do not negatively impact your next key workout. Goals: The goals behind the Recess rides are rather wide-ranging and include adaptations such as increased resistance to muscle damage, enhanced neuromuscular coordination (i.e., improved pedal economy), increased fat metabolism, and even heat acclimation to name a few.

SUMMARY:0:30 - Goddard -5
DESCRIPTION:TSS 35, IF 0.83, kJ(Cal) 348.  Description: The time-crunched version of Goddard consists largely of Form Sprints and Cadence Spin-Ups with a bit of recovery sprinkled on top.You'll first face 7x30-second Form Sprints with 60 seconds of rest between each.Then, you'll finish with 2x6-minute Cadence Spin-Ups with 2 minutes of recovery between them.  Goals: Improvements in form are the name of Goddard's game and this shortest version targets improvements in speed endurance via only slighlty fewer form sprints and the same number of spin-ups.Remember, even the smallest improvements in pedal economy - how hard you work for each pedalstroke - are magnified hundreds, even thousands of times. So pay attention and make each drill matter, it will be worth it.Form sprints can be extremely quick but again, only as fast as you can control - no bouncing. Same goes for the spin-ups: fast, faster, all-out, but no bouncing, no joint pain.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 98, IF 0.81, kJ(Cal) 1003.  Description: Starlight -2 is 3x10-minute over-under intervals alternating between 3 minutes at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals.The set of over-unders is sandwiched 2x18-minute Endurance intervals spent at 65% FTP.  Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.The Endurance intervals are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same adaptations.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 101, IF 0.82, kJ(Cal) 1007.  Description: Reinstein is 3x12-minute over-under intervals alternating between 2 minutes at 95% FTP and 1 minute at 105% FTP with 10-minute active recoveries between intervals. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to develop the ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work. The over-segments or "surges" flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or "valleys" in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still doing a lot of work.These intervals will increase your ability to better process lactate thereby increasing not only how long you can work above FTP but potentially increasing FTP itself. Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Steamboat +2
DESCRIPTION:TSS 71, IF 0.84, kJ(Cal) 713.  Description: Steamboat +2 consists of 5x8-minute spin-ups between 88-94% FTP where leg speed is the focus. Each interval consists of 4 quick minutes, 3 quicker minutes, and 1 really quick minute at relatively low power output.2 minutes of recovery fall between intervals. Goals: The primary focus is Improved pedaling mechanics through the use of high-cadence efforts that cultivate a more efficient pedalstroke and allow better use of energy at all leg speeds.Higher cadences reduce the level of muscle stress and shift the energy demand more toward the aerobic system and away from the anaerobic, sugar-dependent system - many light pedalstrokes utilize less sugar than fewer hard pedalstrokes.Cadence can climb as high as a rider can sustain while exhibiting excellent control but should fall no lower than 90rpm. ILT cadence is a low as necessary to learn single-leg control with a goal cadence of 90rpm/leg for all durations as improvement takes place.

Goals: Sweet Spot intervals combine the benefit of upper-end aerobic conditioning with more demanding muscle endurance. These workouts are challenging but repeatable and only require a relatively quick recovery window due to their manageable nature.By learning to endure long stretches at this power output, you can count on having the endurance necessary to hang on during a long, fast group ride, climb a fire road at a moderately high yet steady pace, or even spend greater durations in your aero or climbing positions without sacrificing power output.Shoot for a seated spin in the 85-95rpm range unless you're trying to raise your natural cadence to a smoother, quicker spin in which case you'll shoot for 95-105rpm.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Eichorn +2
DESCRIPTION:TSS 74, IF 0.86, kJ(Cal) 728.  Description: Eichorn +2 is 2x20-minute intervals at 94% FTP with 5 minutes of recovery between them.  Goals: Sweet Spot intervals combine the benefit of upper-end aerobic conditioning with more demanding muscle endurance. These workouts are challenging but repeatable and only require a relatively quick recovery window due to their manageable nature.By learning to endure long stretches at this power output, you can count on having the endurance necessary to hang on during a long, fast group ride, climb a fire road at a moderately high yet steady pace, or even spend greater durations in your aero or climbing positions without sacrificing power output.Shoot for a seated spin in the 85-95rpm range unless you're trying to raise your natural cadence to a smoother, quicker spin in which case you'll shoot for 95-105rpm.

SUMMARY:1:30 - Leconte
DESCRIPTION:TSS 123, IF 0.90, kJ(Cal) 1142.  Description: Leconte consists of 3 sets of 2x10-minute criss-cross intervals where 2-minute valleys between 95-99% FTP alternate with 30-second surges between 105-110% FTPEach interval criss-crosses your FTP never straying far from it until the brief, 1-minute recoveries within each set or the 5-minute recovery segments between sets. Goals: Leconte's primary goal is to increase your ability to push the pedals hard for longer durations, i.e. increased muscular endurance.The secondary goal is the development of the ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work. Each short surge floods the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to easy up, not that you will. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the valleys in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still doing a lot of work.These intervals will increase your ability to better process lactate thereby increasing how long you can work above FTP while potentially increasing FTP itself.Try to keep your cadence in the 85-95rpm range during the valleys and between 95-105rpm during the surges unless otherwise instructed.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Tumbe
DESCRIPTION:TSS 59, IF 0.77, kJ(Cal) 532.  Description: Tumbe is 3 sets of 5 intervals, each 50 seconds long. Intervals are between 115 and 120% FTP. Recoveries between intervals are just over 2 minutes long and recoveries between sets of intervals are 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Goals: Primarily, these efforts are about improving your maximum aerobic power or your ability to repeatedly operate at or near it.Intervals like these can raise your aerobic ceiling and create room for later improvements in your VO2max, and in the process they'll bring about aerobic adaptations that benefit your performance across the board. Strive for a cadence of 100rpm or even a bit higher during each interval. But if fatigue forces a lack of control at these higher cadences, shoot for something closer to 90rpm and ride smoothly.

Description: Starlight -2 is 3x10-minute over-under intervals alternating between 3 minutes at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals.The set of over-unders is sandwiched 2x18-minute Endurance intervals spent at 65% FTP.  Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.The Endurance intervals are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same adaptations.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

Recoveries between sets of repeats are also pretty short at just 3 minutes each. Goals: The goal of any VO2max workout is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power. By working very hard for brief intervals but only recovering for very short periods of time, these microintervals are extremely effective at improving your ability to sustain and repeat efforts well above FTP. This improved aerobic capacity and power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP. These short-duration repeats offer an opportunity to become accustomed to high-intensity work in probably the most manageable manner that doesn't skimp on productivity.Cadence should exceed 100rpm during every interval, but if fatigue forces a lack of control at higher cadences then shoot for 90+rpm and ride smoothly.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Bird
DESCRIPTION:TSS 79, IF 0.89, kJ(Cal) 612.  Description: Bird is 3 sets of 5x1-minute intervals at 130% FTP where recoveries between intervals are 1 minute long and recoveries between sets of intervals are 8 minutes long.  Goals: Primarily, these efforts are about improving your maximum aerobic power or your ability to repeatedly operate at or near it.Intervals like these can raise your aerobic ceiling and create room for later improvements in your VO2max, and in the process they'll bring about aerobic adaptations that benefit your performance across the board. Strive for a cadence of 100rpm or even a bit higher during each interval. But if fatigue forces a lack of control at these higher cadences, shoot for something closer to 90rpm and ride smoothly.

Description: Warlow +2 is 5x9-minute over-under intervals alternating between 2 minutes pushed up to 98% FTP and 1 minute still at 115% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals. Goals: This workout chiefly aims to develop your ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work and enhance muscle endurance in the process.The surges flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up, don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the valleys in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the buildup while still doing a lot of work.These intervals can increase your ability to better process lactate thereby increasing not only how long you can work above FTP but also increasing FTP itself.Try to keep your cadence in the 85-95rpm range whether enduring a valley or powering through a short surge.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

The second part of North Twin +2 consists of 47 minutes of Sweet Spot-ish work between 85-95% FTP with short bouts of aerobic Endurance riding at 55-75% FTP separating each interval. Goals: The lower-intensity Sweet Spot intervals will continue building aerobic power while the harder efforts are aimed at improving muscular endurance. Try to keep your cadence above 90rpm for the bulk of the workout, and then shoot for something well above 100rpm during the short sprints.Optional: Strength Sprints require the use of a big gear turned as forcefully as you can in order to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible. From a near stop and in the biggest gear you can gracefully turn over without exceeding 90rpm in 12 pedalstrokes, stand and hold onto your handlebar drops while driving each foot down as hard as you can. If you reach 90rpm inside of 12 pedalstrokes (without compromising your form), choose a bigger gear next time. If you're riding a smart trainer in Erg mode, consider switching to Resistance Mode for your Strength Sprints.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Garrowby -3
DESCRIPTION:TSS 67, IF 0.82, kJ(Cal) 689.  Description: Garrowby -3 is a 3x12-minute segmented Sweet Spot workout. Each set consists of 4x3 minutes spent between 88-94% FTP.Recoveries between each short repeat are 30 seconds long, and recoveries between each set of repeats are 90 seconds long. Goals: Working on muscle endurance can be a daunting task when interval durations reach the double digits.By segmenting longer intervals into shorter stretches with short recoveries between them, nearly all of the same benefits are conveyed but without the same rise in bodily strain.Use these segemented workouts when you're struggling with longer, continuous Sweet Spot intervals, when you're new to steady-state work like longer Sweet Spot efforts, or if you're rebounding from illness or injury.Try to keep your cadence above 90rpm unless you're intentionally targeting lower-rpm cadences.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 32, IF 0.57, kJ(Cal) 520.  Description: 1 hour split into 5x10 minute intervals alternating between 55 and 60% FTP with a 5 minute warmup and 5 minute cooldown. Goals: Aerobic Endurance workouts are aimed at improving your aerobic-power-producing capabilities in a low-stress manner. By riding for increasingly longer periods of time, your endurance muscle fibers become more efficient at utilizing fat for fuel and sparing sugar stores for more intense efforts. Additionally, Endurance workouts like this can improve oxygen delivery & utilization, increase muscular resistance to fatigue, improve integrity of connective tissue, and even help you improve your on-bike nutrition strategies.

Intervals are all separated by 2-minute recoveries. Goals: The aim here is to increase muscular endurance via Sweet Spot efforts by expanding your base for more intense workouts later on while increasing power output and endurance at moderate intensities in the process.Additionally, you can work to improve muscle control via low-rpm riding in an effort to pinpoint poor pedaling mechanics as well as strengthen slowly adaptive connective tissues. And why not improve the ability to smoothly transition in & out of the saddle while you're at it?Climbing cadence should fall in the 65-85rpm range and slow-force cadence won't drop lower than 50rpm for most riders.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 78, IF 0.89, kJ(Cal) 726.  Description: Spencer +1 is essentially 7x3-minute VO2max repeats, but they're broken into tightly packed 30-second intervals at 125% FTP paired with brief, 15-second recoveries. Short, 2-minute recoveries fall between each set of intervals.  Goals: By working at very high percentages of your peak aerobic uptake which is well above FTP, you can see sizable improvements in both aerobic and anaerobic power in minimal training time.Not only can high-intensity repeats improve VO2max, they can also impart positive effects on muscle endurance, and most importantly, aerobic endurance capabilities which is especially important for riders working on a very limited amount of weekly training hours. By breaking each longer interval into shorter efforts with even shorter recovery valleys between each, oxygen uptake remains high while muscle fatigue remains manageable.Try to keep your cadence in the 90-110rpm range over the entirety of each set of repeats.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Sill
DESCRIPTION:TSS 74, IF 0.86, kJ(Cal) 670.  Description: Sill is made up of 3x9-minute Over-Under intervals alternating between 1 minute at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP.The warm-up includes 3x2-minute segments of Individual Leg Training (ILT), and recoveries between over-unders are each 5 minutes long. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. The over-segments or 'surges' flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or 'valleys' in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still going pretty hard.These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

Each long interval is split in half by a single 60-second recovery valley.5-minute recoveries fall between intervals.  Goals: Sweet Spot work lays the foundation on which we build higher & higher FTP's and is also the high end of half-distance triathlon power. Build the muscle endurance necessary to power up short hills without flooding your muscles with acidic fatigue via long Sweet Spot intervals and minimal rest periods.This is an uncomfortable but productive power range that doesn't require the same level of recovery as Threshold workouts yet yields many of the same benefits. Intervals like these allow you to work reasonably hard for long durations and do it frequently.Try to maintain a reasonably quick cadence of 85-95rpm over the course of this workout.

Goals: No two ways about it, these are hard. Holding power above FTP is, by its nature, short-term due to the fact that it's a tough place to reside.But by working at mildly suprathreshold power outputs, ones that at take place at high percentages of your VO2max power, you can push your FTP higher while gaining some meaningful aerobic adaptation in the process.On top of that, intervals that induce & sustain high levels of lactate work well toward lifting your physical (and mental) lactate tolerance.Strive for a cadence above 85rpm, preferably one above 95rpm.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Beasley
DESCRIPTION:TSS 81, IF 0.90, kJ(Cal) 745.  Description: Beasley consists of another version of over-under intervals, each lasting 5-9 minutes where the intervals alternate from 45 seconds between 95-97% FTP to 15 seconds between 110-120% FTP. Recoveries between intervals are each 3 minutes long. Goals: As with most over-under intervals, the primary aim is improved lactate processing capabilities, whether improved shuttling, improved tolerance or improved anaerobic & aerobic power output.By riding so close to FTP, it only takes a slight increase in effort to flood the muscles and this workout's increases are more than slight.But they're short allowing tough, aerobically fit riders to find a way to ride through the burn, ride off the accumulation.Try to keep your spin steady and above 90rpm when possible.You can increase your cadence to 110rpm during each 15-second surge or remain steady as though you're pulling into the wind - more work, same speed.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 109, IF 0.85, kJ(Cal) 1033.  Description: Gray +5 consists of 2x20-minute intervals at FTP with 10 minutes of recovery between intervals. Goals: The primary aim of Threshold work is to extend the amount of time you're able to ride at your FTP.As your body grows accustomed to a certain level of stress, your ability to withstand that stress for longer periods of time improves. Before you know it, your muscles don't load up like they used to, your mind isn't completely consumed with the desire to ease up, and your so-called 'hour power' gravitates toward truly sustainable, hour-long power.The recommended cadence range is wide, 85-105rpm, and accommodates many styles of riding. Riders wishing to target improvements in strength endurance will work toward the lower end of this cadence range while those riders seeking less muscle stress and more aerobic contribution will shift their spin upwards toward 100rpm or even a bit higher. In any case, the power output should be even with minimal fluctuations over the course of each interval.

SUMMARY:1:30 - Hot Springs
DESCRIPTION:TSS 97, IF 0.80, kJ(Cal) 1029.  Description: Hot Springs is made up of 3x20-minute intervals between 87-88% FTP. Each long interval is split into shorter segments separated by 60-second recovery valleys, and 4-minute recoveries fall between these segmented intervals.  Goals: Sweet Spot work lays the foundation on which we build higher & higher FTP's and is also the high end of half-distance triathlon power. Build the muscle endurance necessary to power up short hills without flooding your muscles with acidic fatigue via long Sweet Spot intervals and minimal rest periods.This is an uncomfortable but productive power range that doesn't require the same level of recovery as Threshold workouts yet yields many of the same benefits. Intervals like these allow you to work reasonably hard for long durations and do it frequently.Try to maintain a reasonably quick cadence of 85-95rpm over the course of this workout.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Ansel Adams -2
DESCRIPTION:TSS 90, IF 0.95, kJ(Cal) 708.  Description: Ansel Adams -2 consists of 6x6-minute sets of 50/50's where you'll spend 50 seconds at 130% FTP followed by 50 seconds at recovery watts. 2 minutes of recovery fall between each set of intervals.  Goals: The primary goal is to improve maximum aerobic capacity, or the endurance that allows you to work harder and longer with improved oxygen utilization and less sugar-expense.Simultaneously, increasing your anaerobic work capacity is a secondary goal leading to greater speed endurance, improved lactate utilization and improved high-end capabilities.Cadence should exceed 100rpm during every interval, but if fatigue forces a lack of control at higher cadences then shoot for 90+rpm and ride smoothly.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Bear Creek
DESCRIPTION:TSS 81, IF 0.90, kJ(Cal) 735.  Description: Bear Creek is 3x12-minute Over-Under intervals alternating between 2 minutes at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP with 5-minute recoveries between intervals. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. The over-segments or 'surges' flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or 'valleys' in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still going pretty hard.These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.        Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

Each set consists of 5x3-4 minutes spent between 88-94% FTP.Recoveries between each short repeat are 1 minute long, and recoveries between each set of repeats are 2 minutes long. Goals: Working on muscle endurance can be a daunting task when interval durations reach the double digits.By segmenting longer intervals into shorter stretches with short recoveries between them, nearly all of the same benefits are conveyed but without the same rise in bodily strain.Use these segemented workouts when you're struggling with longer, continuous Sweet Spot intervals, when you're new to steady-state work like longer Sweet Spot efforts, or if you're rebounding from illness or injury.Try to keep your cadence above 90rpm unless you're intentionally targeting lower-rpm cadences.

These intervals are bookended by 10-minute stretches of Endurance work that will total 75 minutes of nicely varied ride time. Goals: The goal here is quite simply to elevate FTP.By spending time very close to lactate threshold while remaining just below it, riders can improve their sustainable power & muscle endurance by teaching their muscles to process high levels of lactate & acidic buildup without slowing down. Additionally, and equally as important, riders learn to tolerate the mental discomfort inherent in maintaining high levels of Functional Threshold Power.Cadence should fall in the 85-95rpm range but steady stress and target watts are more important than pedal speed so prioritize accordingly and don?t worry if your cadence falls outside of this range from time to time.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 96, IF 0.88, kJ(Cal) 833.  Description: Kosciuszko -2 consists of 6x5-minute repeats at 108% FTP separated by 5-minute recovery valleys. Goals: A noticeable drop from typical VO2 Max power allows far greater time at a potentially very productive power output well above your current sustainable power.The intent is to build greater muscular endurance and aerobic capacity while forging greater mental toughness. By working at a high percentage of your maximal oxygen uptake with repeats that thoroughly stress your aerobic system, you can start to nudge your FTP closer to the upper limits of your aerobic power. Shoot for a cadence above 85rpm, above 95rpm if possible.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 89, IF 0.77, kJ(Cal) 984.  Description: Dremsel totals over 40 minutes of Sweet Spot intervals spent between 86-90% FTP with intermittent, 4-minute recoveries at 55% FTP.  Goals: The goal here is to continue building aerobic power while refining your climbing technique and familiarizing your body with the different stresses of climbing.Additionally, there's focus on turning the pedals with higher than usual force while still remaining relaxed. You'll also target particular quadrants of the pedalstroke in order to keep power on the pedals more effectively throughout the entire 360-degree pedalstroke by focusing on lifting upward and kicking foward.These intervals are meant to simulate climbs, so try to use cadences that most closely mimic ones you'll use on grades you're likely to encounter in your events or rides.Recommended cadence is above 75rpm when seated and above 65rpm when standing.

Optional form drills include form sprints, endurance-spinning intervals, and various pedalstroke drills. Goals: Endurance workouts are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.    This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same  adaptations. Regarding the form drills, Whorl targets improvements in pedaling mechanics, leg speed and sprinting form, and improved pedal economy.

Goals: Kaweah's primary goal is quite simply to improve muscular endurance while adapting to an increasingly aerodynamic position.Additionally, and equally as important, riders can learn to tolerate the mental discomfort inherent in maintaining high levels of Functional Threshold Power.By spending time very close to lactate threshold while remaining just below it, riders can improve their sustainable power and muscle endurance by teaching their muscles to process high levels of lactate and tolerate the discomfort of acidic buildup without slowing down. Extra emphasis is placed on spending longer periods of time in an increasingly aero position striving to find that balance between aerodynamics and power output.Cadence should fall in the 85-95rpm range but steady stress and target watts are more important than leg speed so prioritize accordingly and don't worry if your cadence falls outside of this range from time to time.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 96, IF 0.80, kJ(Cal) 981.  Description: Ericsson +2 is 6x8-minute Spin-Up intervals between 88-94% FTP where riders begin with a slightly quicker-than-usual spin for the first 4 minutes, increase their pedal speed for the following 3 minutes, and then spin all-out for the final minute. The rest between intervals is 4 minutes and the workout kicks off with 3x2-minute rounds of Isolated Leg Training (ILT) where riders can train each leg's spin individually. Goals: Primarily, Ericsson aims at improvements in sustainable leg speed while improving pedal economy. By pedaling fluidly & quickly, with as little wasted energy as possible, riders can improve their efficiency in the off-season and revisit this workout intermittently during the competitive season, specifically during mid-peak training valleys. Additionally, this workout promotes improvements in high-end aerobic endurance as well as a potential positive effect on muscle endurance.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Flinders
DESCRIPTION:TSS 79, IF 0.89, kJ(Cal) 708.  Description: Flinders consists of 5 sets of 2x3-minute efforts at 105% FTP. Recoveries between intervals only last a quick 30 seconds and recoveries between sets of intervals are 3 minutes long. Goals: Working above FTP is typically about lifting your FTP by stressing both your aerobic and anaerobic energy delivery systems in a joined effort to increase both sets of capabilities. Put simply, workouts like this one are bent on achieving performance improvement, whether aerobically or anerobically driven. The short recoveries lend themselves to a higher level of oxygen uptake within the sets, and the high-intensity efforts themselves address greater anaerobic work capacity at the lower end of that spectrum.As the suprathreshold intervals increasingly stress your anaerobic capabilities, they become more and more aerobic making this workout mostly about improved aerobic capacity.Shoot for a cadence above 100rpm during the intervals if possible, and try not to drop below 90rpm at any point during the workout.

Description: The Recess rides range anywhere from 20-60 minutes in duration at roughly 50% FTP.Exhausted rides, also referred to as 'accumulation rides' are performed within 4-24 hours after your last key workout, race, or event - any other physically stressful ride works as well. These rides should leave you no more fatigued than you were before you hopped on your bike and there are no strict rules governing effort level as long as these feel recuperative and do not negatively impact your next key workout. Goals: The goals behind the Recess rides are rather wide-ranging and include adaptations such as increased resistance to muscle damage, enhanced neuromuscular coordination (i.e., improved pedal economy), increased fat metabolism, and even heat acclimation to name a few.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Garrowby -3
DESCRIPTION:TSS 67, IF 0.82, kJ(Cal) 689.  Description: Garrowby -3 is a 3x12-minute segmented Sweet Spot workout. Each set consists of 4x3 minutes spent between 88-94% FTP.Recoveries between each short repeat are 30 seconds long, and recoveries between each set of repeats are 90 seconds long. Goals: Working on muscle endurance can be a daunting task when interval durations reach the double digits.By segmenting longer intervals into shorter stretches with short recoveries between them, nearly all of the same benefits are conveyed but without the same rise in bodily strain.Use these segemented workouts when you're struggling with longer, continuous Sweet Spot intervals, when you're new to steady-state work like longer Sweet Spot efforts, or if you're rebounding from illness or injury.Try to keep your cadence above 90rpm unless you're intentionally targeting lower-rpm cadences.

Goals: The goal of slightly suprathreshold workouts is to extend high power over greater durations. By riding only slightly above your current FTP, you'll become accustomed - both physically and mentally - to a workload just beyond your current sustainable reach.  These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position.Strive to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

SUMMARY:0:30 - Goddard -5
DESCRIPTION:TSS 35, IF 0.83, kJ(Cal) 348.  Description: The time-crunched version of Goddard consists largely of Form Sprints and Cadence Spin-Ups with a bit of recovery sprinkled on top.You'll first face 7x30-second Form Sprints with 60 seconds of rest between each.Then, you'll finish with 2x6-minute Cadence Spin-Ups with 2 minutes of recovery between them.  Goals: Improvements in form are the name of Goddard's game and this shortest version targets improvements in speed endurance via only slighlty fewer form sprints and the same number of spin-ups.Remember, even the smallest improvements in pedal economy - how hard you work for each pedalstroke - are magnified hundreds, even thousands of times. So pay attention and make each drill matter, it will be worth it.Form sprints can be extremely quick but again, only as fast as you can control - no bouncing. Same goes for the spin-ups: fast, faster, all-out, but no bouncing, no joint pain.

Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.The Endurance intervals are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same adaptations.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

Each interval consists of 4 quick minutes, 3 quicker minutes, and 1 really quick minute at relatively low power output.2 minutes of recovery fall between intervals. Goals: The primary focus is Improved pedaling mechanics through the use of high-cadence efforts that cultivate a more efficient pedalstroke and allow better use of energy at all leg speeds.Higher cadences reduce the level of muscle stress and shift the energy demand more toward the aerobic system and away from the anaerobic, sugar-dependent system - many light pedalstrokes utilize less sugar than fewer hard pedalstrokes.Cadence can climb as high as a rider can sustain while exhibiting excellent control but should fall no lower than 90rpm. ILT cadence is a low as necessary to learn single-leg control with a goal cadence of 90rpm/leg for all durations as improvement takes place.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 123, IF 0.90, kJ(Cal) 1142.  Description: Leconte consists of 3 sets of 2x10-minute criss-cross intervals where 2-minute valleys between 95-99% FTP alternate with 30-second surges between 105-110% FTPEach interval criss-crosses your FTP never straying far from it until the brief, 1-minute recoveries within each set or the 5-minute recovery segments between sets. Goals: Leconte's primary goal is to increase your ability to push the pedals hard for longer durations, i.e. increased muscular endurance.The secondary goal is the development of the ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work. Each short surge floods the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to easy up, not that you will. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the valleys in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still doing a lot of work.These intervals will increase your ability to better process lactate thereby increasing how long you can work above FTP while potentially increasing FTP itself.Try to keep your cadence in the 85-95rpm range during the valleys and between 95-105rpm during the surges unless otherwise instructed.

These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.The Endurance intervals are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same adaptations.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Cape Range
DESCRIPTION:TSS 70, IF 0.83, kJ(Cal) 639.  Description: Cape Range is 4x5-minute repeats at 106% FTP where each interval is split in half by a 30-second recovery valley. Each full interval is separated by a 5 and a half minute recovery valley. Goals: A noticeable drop from typical VO2 Max power allows far greater time at a potentially very productive power output well above your current sustainable power.The intent is to build greater muscular endurance and mental toughness by working at a high percentage of your maximal oxygen uptake with repeats that thoroughly stress your aerobic system. Shoot for a cadence above 85rpm, above 95rpm if possible.

Description: Reinstein is 3x12-minute over-under intervals alternating between 2 minutes at 95% FTP and 1 minute at 105% FTP with 10-minute active recoveries between intervals. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to develop the ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work. The over-segments or "surges" flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or "valleys" in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still doing a lot of work.These intervals will increase your ability to better process lactate thereby increasing not only how long you can work above FTP but potentially increasing FTP itself. Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Brasted
DESCRIPTION:TSS 71, IF 0.84, kJ(Cal) 686.  Description: Brasted consists of 3 sets of 13x30/15's where you'll ride at 120% FTP for 30 seconds before recovering briefly for only 15 seconds between repeats. Recoveries between sets of repeats are also pretty short at just 3 minutes each. Goals: The goal of any VO2max workout is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power. By working very hard for brief intervals but only recovering for very short periods of time, these microintervals are extremely effective at improving your ability to sustain and repeat efforts well above FTP. This improved aerobic capacity and power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP. These short-duration repeats offer an opportunity to become accustomed to high-intensity work in probably the most manageable manner that doesn't skimp on productivity.Cadence should exceed 100rpm during every interval, but if fatigue forces a lack of control at higher cadences then shoot for 90+rpm and ride smoothly.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Spencer +1
DESCRIPTION:TSS 78, IF 0.89, kJ(Cal) 726.  Description: Spencer +1 is essentially 7x3-minute VO2max repeats, but they're broken into tightly packed 30-second intervals at 125% FTP paired with brief, 15-second recoveries. Short, 2-minute recoveries fall between each set of intervals.  Goals: By working at very high percentages of your peak aerobic uptake which is well above FTP, you can see sizable improvements in both aerobic and anaerobic power in minimal training time.Not only can high-intensity repeats improve VO2max, they can also impart positive effects on muscle endurance, and most importantly, aerobic endurance capabilities which is especially important for riders working on a very limited amount of weekly training hours. By breaking each longer interval into shorter efforts with even shorter recovery valleys between each, oxygen uptake remains high while muscle fatigue remains manageable.Try to keep your cadence in the 90-110rpm range over the entirety of each set of repeats.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Sill
DESCRIPTION:TSS 74, IF 0.86, kJ(Cal) 670.  Description: Sill is made up of 3x9-minute Over-Under intervals alternating between 1 minute at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP.The warm-up includes 3x2-minute segments of Individual Leg Training (ILT), and recoveries between over-unders are each 5 minutes long. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. The over-segments or 'surges' flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or 'valleys' in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still going pretty hard.These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

SUMMARY:1:30 - Andrews
DESCRIPTION:TSS 73, IF 0.70, kJ(Cal) 958.  Description: Andrews is 90 minutes of aerobic Endurance riding spent somewhere between 65-75% FTP. Goals: Aerobic Endurance training is primarily about cultivating a strong, wide aerobic base that includes all of the physiological adaptations inherent in long, steady, low-intensity riding, e.g. improved fat metabolism, energy delivery & glycogen conservation, lower HR/higher aerobic power, improved neuromuscular efficiency, etc.As time-constrained as most riding schedules are though, shorter Endurance rides done consistently can make up for some of the lacking pro-rider time availability.Try to hold your spin within an 85-95rpm range & spend ample time adapting to & modifying your position on the bike while the workload is more manageable.

SUMMARY:1:15 - Whorl
DESCRIPTION:TSS 50, IF 0.63, kJ(Cal) 718.  Description: Whorl consists of 75 minutes of aerobic Endurance work spent between 60-70% FTP. Optional form drills include form sprints, endurance-spinning intervals, and various pedalstroke drills. Goals: Endurance workouts are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.    This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same  adaptations. Regarding the form drills, Whorl targets improvements in pedaling mechanics, leg speed and sprinting form, and improved pedal economy.

SUMMARY:0:25 - Ramp Test
DESCRIPTION:TSS 34, IF 0.91, kJ(Cal) 279.  Description: The Ramp Test is a fitness assessment that uses gradual increases in power to estimate your FTP. The process is simple: follow the target power as closely as possible until you can?t sustain the effort. Once you stop pedaling, your FTP will be automatically calculated and you can choose to accept or reject it.Stay in the saddle for the entire test, which usually takes about 25 minutes and starts with a short, easy warmup. Once the warmup is complete the target power will slightly increase each minute until it becomes very difficult to sustain. This is when you need to push yourself, turning the pedals and trying to maintain the target power until you?re no longer capable of doing so. This challenging period only lasts a few minutes, but for the test to be accurate, it?s important to give it everything you?ve got.The test will continue as long as you can match the target power, but once your power drops there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling, and a window will appear asking if you?re finished; click ?End Test? and your FTP will be calculated and displayed. If you accept it, your new FTP will automatically be used to set the intensity of your future workouts.Tips and Hints:- Follow the target power as closely as you can throughout the entire test. Small variations are normal, but surging above or below target for extended periods can affect the results. - For the best results, do the Ramp Test when you?re fueled, motivated, and well rested.- Smart Trainers and ERG mode work great for the Ramp Test but are not required. Use whatever trainer mode you typically use when training. - Use whatever cadence feels most comfortable. A steady cadence may help you sustain a steady power output when things get tough.- Once you reach your limit and your power begins to drop, there?s no reason to keep going. Stop pedaling and recover as your result is calculated.-If you?re a triathlete or time trialist and you plan to do most of your training in aero position, we recommend taking the Ramp Test in this position. Goals: By following a convenient, tightly structured assessment protocol, riders can assess changes in fitness at any time of their training season. This short test estimates FTP from an athlete?s ability to sustain a gradually increasing but minimally fatiguing effort.This test shouldn't require full recovery ahead of testing, but you should be well-rested and properly motivated enough to go truly all-out during the last few crucial minutes.

SUMMARY:1:30 - Gray +5
DESCRIPTION:TSS 109, IF 0.85, kJ(Cal) 1033.  Description: Gray +5 consists of 2x20-minute intervals at FTP with 10 minutes of recovery between intervals. Goals: The primary aim of Threshold work is to extend the amount of time you're able to ride at your FTP.As your body grows accustomed to a certain level of stress, your ability to withstand that stress for longer periods of time improves. Before you know it, your muscles don't load up like they used to, your mind isn't completely consumed with the desire to ease up, and your so-called 'hour power' gravitates toward truly sustainable, hour-long power.The recommended cadence range is wide, 85-105rpm, and accommodates many styles of riding. Riders wishing to target improvements in strength endurance will work toward the lower end of this cadence range while those riders seeking less muscle stress and more aerobic contribution will shift their spin upwards toward 100rpm or even a bit higher. In any case, the power output should be even with minimal fluctuations over the course of each interval.

Each long interval is split into shorter segments separated by 60-second recovery valleys, and 4-minute recoveries fall between these segmented intervals.  Goals: Sweet Spot work lays the foundation on which we build higher & higher FTP's and is also the high end of half-distance triathlon power. Build the muscle endurance necessary to power up short hills without flooding your muscles with acidic fatigue via long Sweet Spot intervals and minimal rest periods.This is an uncomfortable but productive power range that doesn't require the same level of recovery as Threshold workouts yet yields many of the same benefits. Intervals like these allow you to work reasonably hard for long durations and do it frequently.Try to maintain a reasonably quick cadence of 85-95rpm over the course of this workout.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Bear Creek
DESCRIPTION:TSS 81, IF 0.90, kJ(Cal) 735.  Description: Bear Creek is 3x12-minute Over-Under intervals alternating between 2 minutes at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP with 5-minute recoveries between intervals. Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. The over-segments or 'surges' flood the muscle with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up - don't. Hold that burn, then back off only slightly during the under-segments or 'valleys' in order to work through the burn and effectively train your muscles to process the lactic buildup while still going pretty hard.These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.        Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.

These intervals are bookended by 10-minute stretches of Endurance work that will total 75 minutes of nicely varied ride time. Goals: The goal here is quite simply to elevate FTP.By spending time very close to lactate threshold while remaining just below it, riders can improve their sustainable power & muscle endurance by teaching their muscles to process high levels of lactate & acidic buildup without slowing down. Additionally, and equally as important, riders learn to tolerate the mental discomfort inherent in maintaining high levels of Functional Threshold Power.Cadence should fall in the 85-95rpm range but steady stress and target watts are more important than pedal speed so prioritize accordingly and don?t worry if your cadence falls outside of this range from time to time.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 50, IF 0.63, kJ(Cal) 718.  Description: Whorl consists of 75 minutes of aerobic Endurance work spent between 60-70% FTP. Optional form drills include form sprints, endurance-spinning intervals, and various pedalstroke drills. Goals: Endurance workouts are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.    This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same  adaptations. Regarding the form drills, Whorl targets improvements in pedaling mechanics, leg speed and sprinting form, and improved pedal economy.

DESCRIPTION:TSS 58, IF 0.68, kJ(Cal) 774.  Description: Collins is 75 minutes of aerobic Endurance riding spent somewhere between 65-75% FTP. Goals: Aerobic Endurance training is primarily about cultivating a strong, wide aerobic base that includes all of the physiological adaptations inherent in long, steady, low-intensity riding, e.g. improved fat metabolism, energy delivery and glycogen conservation, lower HR/higher aerobic power, improved neuromuscular efficiency, etc.As time-constrained as most riding schedules are though, shorter Endurance rides done consistently can make up for some of the lacking pro-rider time availability.Try to hold your spin within an 85-95rpm range and spend ample time adapting to and modifying your position on the bike while the workload is more manageable.

SUMMARY:1:00 - Tumbe
DESCRIPTION:TSS 59, IF 0.77, kJ(Cal) 532.  Description: Tumbe is 3 sets of 5 intervals, each 50 seconds long. Intervals are between 115 and 120% FTP. Recoveries between intervals are just over 2 minutes long and recoveries between sets of intervals are 3 minutes and 40 seconds. Goals: Primarily, these efforts are about improving your maximum aerobic power or your ability to repeatedly operate at or near it.Intervals like these can raise your aerobic ceiling and create room for later improvements in your VO2max, and in the process they'll bring about aerobic adaptations that benefit your performance across the board. Strive for a cadence of 100rpm or even a bit higher during each interval. But if fatigue forces a lack of control at these higher cadences, shoot for something closer to 90rpm and ride smoothly.

Goals: Kaweah's primary goal is quite simply to improve muscular endurance while adapting to an increasingly aerodynamic position.Additionally, and equally as important, riders can learn to tolerate the mental discomfort inherent in maintaining high levels of Functional Threshold Power.By spending time very close to lactate threshold while remaining just below it, riders can improve their sustainable power and muscle endurance by teaching their muscles to process high levels of lactate and tolerate the discomfort of acidic buildup without slowing down. Extra emphasis is placed on spending longer periods of time in an increasingly aero position striving to find that balance between aerodynamics and power output.Cadence should fall in the 85-95rpm range but steady stress and target watts are more important than leg speed so prioritize accordingly and don't worry if your cadence falls outside of this range from time to time.

Each full interval is separated by a 5 and a half minute recovery valley. Goals: A noticeable drop from typical VO2 Max power allows far greater time at a potentially very productive power output well above your current sustainable power.The intent is to build greater muscular endurance and mental toughness by working at a high percentage of your maximal oxygen uptake with repeats that thoroughly stress your aerobic system. Shoot for a cadence above 85rpm, above 95rpm if possible.

Description: Starlight -2 is 3x10-minute over-under intervals alternating between 3 minutes at 95% FTP and 2 minutes at 105% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals.The set of over-unders is sandwiched 2x18-minute Endurance intervals spent at 65% FTP.  Goals: The primary objective of over-unders is to increase your ability to tolerate and utilize the byproducts that accompany riding above your FTP, all while maintaining a reasonably high power output. In doing so, you'll develop the ability to handle changes in pace while doing quite a lot of work. These intervals can increase how long you can work above FTP as well as how quickly you can reprocess the lactate buildup that can lead to muscle acidity. Equally as important, the short efforts above your current FTP can actually lead to increases in FTP.The Endurance intervals are aimed at improving your aerobic power production capabilities in a steady, low-stress manner. By training your endurance muscle fibers to better utilize oxygen to metabolize fat as fuel, your muscles can spare sugar stores for more intense efforts.This long/slow approach to fostering aerobic capabilities is the lighter, kinder alternative to high-intensity repeats, but both approaches target many of the same adaptations.Try to keep your cadence above 85rpm, preferably above 95rpm.
