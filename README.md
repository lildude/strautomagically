# Strautomagically

Webhook endpoint that runs on Azure Functions to do stuff automagically to my Strava activities as they appear.
Inspired by [Klimat](https://klimat.app/) and [Strautomator](https://strautomator.com).

## ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

This is very much WIP and it more of a tinker tool to help me learn Go with a purpose.
There's no guarantee, yet, that any of the info below is accurate of this even works.
As such I've disabled issues and I'm not taking PRs.
Feel free to fork and tinker for your own purposes.
If I spot a fork and find something I like that you've done, I will pinch it ðŸ˜œ.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You will need to create an API application in [your settings on Strava](https://www.strava.com/settings/api) and take note of the client ID and secret.
If you are running this locally, you will need to set the callback domain to `localhost:8080`, or your ngrok URL if you want to use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
You will also need a Redis database which is used to store the authentication and refresh tokens.
I use a free database from [Redis](https://redis.com/try-free/) as it's cheaper than Azure ðŸ˜œ.
Optional: If you want to add weather information to your entries, you will need to register for a free [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) account and obtain an API key.

### Running Locally

1. Create a `.env` file and set the following:
   - `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` & `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` to the values from Strava
   - `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` to the callback domain you registered followed by `/auth`, eg `http://localhost:8080/auth`
   - `STRAVA_CALLBACK_URI` to the same domain as you registered followed by `/webhook` eg `http://localhost:8080/webhook`
   - `STRAVA_VERIFY_TOKEN` to any random unique string
   - `STATE_TOKEN` to any random unique string
   - `REDIS_URL` to the database URL for your Redis database in the form `redis://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/<database>:<port>`.
     If you're using Heroku, you can use the URL Heroku uses.
   - Optional: `OWM_API_KEY` to the OpenWeather API key.
1. Copy those same settings to `local.settings.json` as it makes it easy to set these in the Azure Functions configuration.
1. Configure your rules in the `update.go` file. I plan to move this out to a better place in future.
1. Run: `make start` and then visit the `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` URL and authorize the application with Strava.
1. Go for a run.

### Deployment

1. Create the Azure Functions app...
  - in the Azure portal:
    <details><summary>How to set up a custom handler Azure Function</summary>
    <p>

    Start by searching for Function App in the Azure Portal and click Create.
    The important settings for this are below, other settings you can use default or your own preferences.

    [Basic]

    1. Publish: Code
    2. Runtime stack: Custom Handler
    3. Version: custom

    [Hosting]

    1. Operating System: Linux
    2. Plan type: Consumption (Serverless)

    </p>
    </details>

    ... or ...
    
  - in [VSCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other?tabs=go%2Clinux#create-the-function-app-in-azure)
  
2. Create an Azure Service Principal for RBAC for the deployment credentials. Follow [these](https://github.com/Azure/functions-action/blob/d4e7f5d24dc958f6904ffd095fe5033d474abe49/README.md#using-azure-service-principal-for-rbac-as-deployment-credential) instructions.
3. Add the configuration variables from the `.env` file above to the Azure function configuration, or if you added them to `local.settings.json` too, use the VSCode Azure Functions extension to upload them.  
4. Deploy using your preferred method - either manually from the Azure Functions extension in VSCode or using the GitHub workflow by merging a PR into `main` or pushing directly to main.
5. Visit the `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` URL and authorize the application with Strava.
6. Go for a run.
